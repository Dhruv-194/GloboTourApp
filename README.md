# GloboTourApp 

An app made to practice Creating High-quality UX with the help of AndroidX libraries and material design implementations. 

## What is the app about? 
The app shows a list of cities in recyclerview inside a material designed cardview. The card also has the option to delete the item from the list or add the item to the favourite lists by clicking on the respective buttons. The user can then navigate to the 'Favorites Section' by using the bottom navigation bar. In the Favorites Fragments the there is another list of items added as favorites. The user can then do hand jestures of swiping right or left to delete the item from the favorites lists. 

## What I have used to make this : 
- Android Jetpack's Navigation Component
- AndroidX libraries to implement recyclerview and cardview 
- Created the list using the RecyclerView
- Used gestures to drag and delete items in the list inside the RecyclerView
- Adding NAvigation Drawer : Bottom Navigation Bar
